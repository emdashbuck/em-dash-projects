				<li class="maybe">Title: Personal Infrastructure</li>
				<li>I'm Dash. I'm an organization nerd who's fascinated by the power of habit. My interests range widely, but everything I post has some connection to project management, organization, process improvement (both business and personal), and/or design.
				
				Longer pieces <a>here.</a> Mostly a log of my current projects and topics of research. You can find me on <a>Twitter,</a> too.
				</li>
				<li>QUERY</li>
				
				
				
				
				
				
			<li class="o">Pro Tumblr content (~100 words each. If explodes into >500 words, queue for blog instead and link to on Tumblr/Twitter with quote.)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Social Media<ul>
			<em>Daily misc content, weekly blog updates, and call for testers</em>
			<li>Facebook - Casual mention on personal account when post goes up</li>
			<li>Tumblr<ul>
				<li>Create "pro" tumblr: focus is on creating and my special interests (organization, systems, UI, process improvement, etc)<ul>
					<li class="o">Sub-tumblr or separate main? Pros and cons?</li>
					<li>Theme</li>
					<li>Find tumblrs to follow: Design (graphic, video games, UI), writing (esp technical), coding, crafting, asthetic</li>
					<li>Fill up the queue: Tag, use content from Twitter/Facebook if nesc, minimum capslock, no og swearing (reblogging swears ok if content is worth it). Balance between Tumblr linguistics and pro speak as best you can.</li>
					<li>Set queue to drop 1-4 posts a day, one of which is og content/commentary</li>
					<li>Add link to Pro tumblr in description of main tumblr</li>

	</ul></li>

</ul>
<h2>Ideas</h2>
Side-Tumblr: Delightful-Interface where I post nothing but beautiful UI
Side-Tumblr: Infrastructure-Improvement/Infrastructure-Projects or maybe just Infra-Structure where I post all of my "here is how we fix society/politics/government/whatever" stuff. Or maybe just my SJW blog with a focus on infrastructure improvement as a way to fix issues.
Side-Tumblr: Fortuitous-Iteration where I geek out about evolution and/or success stories (fortune and iteration over problems are both needed.)
Side-Tumblr: Complex-Context where my fandom meta lives
Side-Tumblr: Your Point of View [/Frame of Reference]is a Habit which might also be an sjw blog with a focus on personal opinions and institutional prejudice
Side-Tumblr: Choice Iteration /Choice Analysis- all about habit change
Side-Tumblr: Improvement Process - all about process improvement and what that looks like inside organizations and at home
Side-Tumblr: Mind's Eye Architecture (Inception fan side blog? I DON'T KNOW IT JUST SOUNDS COOL)
Other cool names: Mind's Eye View, the right choice depends on your frame of reference, Mind's Eye Context, Choice Context, enthusiastic progression, interests iteration, personal infrastructure

<h2>Road Map</h2>

To enhance my relationships with my potential clients, potential coworkers, community, and myself through the creation of online content/pieces of asymmetrical communication.
<h3>Scope</h3>

	<li>300 &lt;200 word pieces suitable for Tumblr publishing</li>
	<li>Solidified writing habit that assures continual creation<ul>
		<li>I will know I have met this project requirement when I have written x number of words x number of days in a row with x% misses. (Milestones will provide these numbers).</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Structures that support reliable weekly/tri-weekly/daily publishing<ul>
		<li>SOPs and checklists for weekly, tri-weekly, and daily publishing</li>
		<li>Plans/backups for mistakes and emergencies (e.g. backup posts if a post doesn't happen, etc.)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Professional website Pages copy<ul>
		<li>About Me/Welcome/Contact</li>
