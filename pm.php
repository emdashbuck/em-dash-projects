<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<h4>Goal Sentence/s</h4>
<p>This is what I want to get out of this project. It may be tangible or intangible. This is the <i>why,</i> and often includes the big-picture <i>how.</i></p>
<h4>Specs/Scope</h4>
<p>This is what the project covers. This is the <i>how,</i>with a bit of the big-picture <i>what.</i></p>
<h4>Milestones</h4>
<p>This is a list of understandable/obvious and achievable pieces of the specs/scope listed in chronological order. This is the small-picture <i>what</i> and a bit of the <i>how, </i>as well as <i>when.</i></p>
<br>
<p>All of these things should be written out and kept where I can refer to them often during the course of the project, especially when making decisions.</p>

<h2>Checklists</h2>
<h3>Weekly Project Review</h3>
<ol class="num">
	<li>Pack bag (Make sure I have everything that keeps me focused and comfortable with me)</li>
	<li>Shower &amp; dress (important for mindset)</li>
	<li>Travel to Working Location (Not home, so easier to do work instead of relax/play)<ul>
		<li>Coffee Shop</li>
		<li>Desk (Basically pretend to be at coffee shop)<ol>
			<li>Put everything other than tech hookups elsewhere</li>
			<li>Put bag next to chair on the floor</li>
			<li>Make fancy drink</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Write general idea about how week went, how the weekend went, etc. (Journalling is a standard warmup for me, gets me in the right mindset and also allows me to write out anything that's on my mind and could get in the way.)</li>
	<li>Read Daily Reports and take notes. Mark questions and conclusions strongly so they'll get answered and included. (Review, and see if my general idea of how the week went matches my records of how the week went. Questions and conclusions that occur during this review will form the backbone of the Weekly Report.)</li>
	<li>Rough out Weekly Report. May include the following topics (will probably need to be adjusted as I figure out how to write these):<ul>
		<li>Intro to week's milestone, how the milestone relates to the goal of the project</li>
		<li>Whether or not the milestone is complete and why</li>
		<li>Breakdown what happened by task if necessary</li>
		<li>Any meta conclusions about the system or suggested adjustments</li>
		<li>Adjustments to the timeline and next week's milestone</li>
		<li>Conclusion: What needs work, what went well, what's next.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Read Project Ideas list on pm.php</li>
	<li>Choose next week's projects (see Project Kanban)</li>
	<li>If not doing a Daily Report, choose Tomorrow's Goals</li>
	<li>Rewarding activity/item, e.g. dance party, danish, etc. (Important for habit reinforcement! Do not skip!)</li>
</ol>
