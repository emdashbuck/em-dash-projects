<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<h4>Goal Sentence/s</h4>
This is what I want to get out of this project. It may be tangible or intangible. This is the <i>why,</i> and often includes the big-picture <i>how.</i>
<h4>Specs/Scope</h4>
This is what the project covers. This is the <i>how,</i>with a bit of the big-picture <i>what.</i>
<h4>Milestones</h4>
This is a list of understandable/obvious and achievable pieces of the specs/scope listed in chronological order. This is the small-picture <i>what</i> and a bit of the <i>how, </i>as well as <i>when.</i>
<br>
<p>All of these things should be written out and kept where I can refer to them often during the course of the project, especially when making decisions.</p>
